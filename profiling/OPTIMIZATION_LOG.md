# Vector Optimization Log

Tracks all E2E-validated performance optimizations to Vector's hot path.
Each entry includes isolated and cumulative E2E throughput impact measured
via Docker profiling (1 GB log file, `--profiler none`, 4-core pinning).

Mean after: 294.33  Mean baseline: 271.31
Δ vs cumulative baseline: +8.5%
```

Note: Docker Desktop environment changed between original measurements and iter 2
(cumulative baseline shifted from ~208 to ~271 MiB/s). The A/B comparison was done
in the same session with alternating runs to control for this. On macOS native
(without jemalloc), the delta was only +0.14%, confirming the savings are
allocator-dependent — `getrandom(2)` on Linux is significantly more expensive
than macOS `SecRandomCopyBytes` for per-event UUID generation.

### Notes

- E2E pipeline: `file` source → `remap` (VRL parse_json + add fields) → `filter` (VRL condition) → `blackhole` sink
- Docker image built with `CARGO_PROFILE_RELEASE_DEBUG=2` for symbol retention, jemalloc allocator
- 4-core CPU pinning via `cpuset: "0-3"` in docker-compose
- The wide 95% CIs are dominated by master baseline variance (σ=9.97). All optimized runs consistently exceed 200 MiB/s while master has one run at 185.73 MiB/s
- Individual optimizations show similar deltas (+3.8% to +5.4%) but cumulative is only +6.6%, indicating overlapping hot-path coverage rather than independent bottlenecks
- The optimizations target different points on the same per-event path: Arc::make_mut avoidance (iter 9), Arc reuse (iter 10), clone elimination (iter 11), and hash speedup (iter 15)

## Commit Details

### Optimization 1 — metadata Arc restructure

Files: `lib/vector-core/src/event/metadata.rs`, `lib/vector-core/src/event/proto.rs`

`upstream_id` and `schema_definition` are updated at every transform output.
When inside `Arc<Inner>`, each update triggers `Arc::make_mut` which deep-clones
the entire `Inner` struct. Moving them to top-level `EventMetadata` fields makes
updates simple field assignments.

### Optimization 2 — decompose/recompose + eager size cache

Files: `lib/vector-core/src/event/log_event.rs`, `lib/vector-core/src/event/vrl_target.rs`, `lib/vector-core/src/event/mod.rs`

`LogEvent::decompose()` extracts the `Value` for in-place VRL mutation via
`mem::replace`, keeping the `Arc<Inner>` alive. `recompose()` puts the mutated
value back without a new heap allocation. Additionally, `recompose()` eagerly
computes and caches `json_encoded_size` and `allocated_bytes` so the main
thread's `send_single_buffer` reads cached values instead of recomputing.

### Optimization 3 — ReadOnlyVrlTarget

Files: `lib/vector-core/src/event/vrl_target.rs`, `src/conditions/*.rs`, `src/transforms/*.rs` (7 transforms)

`ReadOnlyVrlTarget` wraps `LogEvent` for read-only VRL condition evaluation
(filter, route, sample, throttle, etc.) without cloning the event's `Value`.
Returns errors on mutation attempts — safe because conditions never modify events.

### Optimization 4 — AHash for transform output buffers

Files: `lib/vector-core/Cargo.toml`, `lib/vector-core/src/transform/outputs.rs`, `src/transforms/remap.rs`, `Cargo.lock`

Replaces `HashMap` with `AHashMap` for `TransformOutputsBuf`. This map is
looked up on every event dispatch. AHash is faster for short string keys
(output names like "\_default"). `ahash` is already a transitive dependency.

### Optimization 5 — lazy event metadata

Files: `lib/vector-core/src/event/metadata.rs`, `lib/vector-core/src/event/log_event.rs`

Two changes targeting per-event creation overhead:

1. **Cache `default_schema_definition()` with `LazyLock`**: Every `EventMetadata::default()`
   previously allocated a new `schema::Definition` (BTreeMap, BTreeSet, 2 Kind objects)
   wrapped in `Arc`. Now a single static instance is shared via `Arc::clone`, turning
   a heap allocation into a cheap atomic increment.

2. **Skip `Uuid::new_v4()` in `Inner::default()`**: The `source_event_id` field was
   eagerly generated for every event but never read by any transform, source, or sink
   in the pipeline. Only serialized in protobuf (which handles `None` gracefully).
   Deferring generation saves the `getrandom(2)` syscall on Linux (~50-100ns per event).
